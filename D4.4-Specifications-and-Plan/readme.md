## TARGET AUDIENCE

This document is intended for both technical and non-technical readers. It intends to provide a
reasonable amount of background and context information in order to better support understanding
the work, scope and focus of the Urban open Platform work package.

## PURPOSE
While the primary purpose of the document is to act as an official deliverable of the FINEST Twins
Work Package 4, this work also aims to provide an overview and guidance to all the stakeholders
involved with the smart city projects. It also presents some findings of several Horizon 2020 projects
that implemented the Urban Platform concept in a way suitable for the scope of each project.
It should be noted that the technical design and architecture presented in this work is not intended to
be generic nor replacement of the earlier reference architectures, such as the Espresso reference
architecture. The FINEST Twins project is unique in a way that it strongly builds on top of the existing
data platforms and capabilities the cities of Helsinki and Tallinn have. Also, in the Espresso project
then intention was that the reference architecture and design principles would be the basis for the
cities to choose their own focus areas with related logical architectures and after that to define the
specific solution architecture.

> This project has received funding from the European Commission (H2020 grant No. 856602) and the
Estonian Government (Estonian Ministry for Education and Research).
